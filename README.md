Assignment

    Make a project directory and create the following files inside that directory:
        index.html
        about.html
        contact-me.html
        404.html
    Create your node.js server file index.js and add the code needed to serve the right page according to the url.
        localhost:8080 should take users to index.html
        localhost:8080/about should take users to about.html
        localhost:8080/contact-me should take users to contact-me.html
        404.html should display any time the user tries to go to a page not listed above.

Go back to your Basic Informational Site project, install Express and rewrite the project using it! You should be able to do most of this with just a few app.get()s.
